This library simplies the player/gadget interface making it easier\nto build full featured gadgets utilizing the Angular framework.\nQuickstart\nNew to Angular? Check out the Angular documentation for getting your environment configured for development.\nStep 1. GitHub Repository Creation (Optional)\nNot hosting your app on Github? Skip to step #2.\nCreate a new repository on GitHub.com. For more information, see \"Creating a new repository.\"\nCopy your remote repository URL\n\ngit remote add origin \n# Sets the new remote\ngit remote -v\n# Verifies the new remote URLStep 2. Create a new Angular app\nFrom within your working folder, run the following Angular CLI command using the name of your app.\nng new my-app --directory ./\n# Generates the boilerplate code for a new Angular appStep 3. Add the Revel Digital libaries\nRun the Revel Digital angular schematic which will configure your app for use as a Revel Digital gadget.\nng add @reveldigital/player-client\n# Run the Revel Digital Angular schematicStep 4. Build\nThe build script will generate the Angular app along with a the gadget XML definition file.\nnpm run build:gadget\n# Run the gadget build scriptStep 5. Deploy\nThe app can be hosted using any number of hosting services, however the provided schematic includes a simplified option for publishing to GitHub Pages.\nAssuming your working folder is associated with your GitHub repository, simply run the following command to deploy the app to the gh-pages branch.
